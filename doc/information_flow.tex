\section{Information flow}

The client will always be the initiator in either requesting data from the
server or sending data. 

Figure \ref{fig:information_flow} shows how information passes when a client
requests a user list. The steps are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        \texttt{main.py} is run with the handle \textbf{-u}, which will check
        \texttt{users.definition.Users} for which URL to access on the server
        to retrieve the information.
    \item
        A request is sent to the server to retrieve the information.
    \item
        The server creates an XML document with a list of users for the site.
        
        The XML document sent is defined by the MetaDoc DTD.
    \item
        \texttt{main.py} recieves the XML document, checks that it is valid
        according to the DTD. 
    \item
        If the XML document passes validation, an instance of
        \texttt{users.definition.Users} is created, and an instance of
        \texttt{users.entries.UserEntry} is created for each
        \texttt{<user\_entry>} in the XML document.

        \texttt{users.definition.Users} and \texttt{users.entries.UserEntry}
        may validate attributes and refuse to create any elements where
        attribute validation does not pass.
    \item
        The list of validated \texttt{users.entries.UserEntry} instances is
        placed within \texttt{self.items} for an
        \texttt{custom.updateusers.UpdateUsers} instance, and the
        \texttt{process()} function is called for the processing of the user
        list.
\end{enumerate}
