\section{Extending MetaDoc}
\label{sec:extending}
MetaDoc is explicitly designed to allow for future enhancements in case more
information should be sent. In order to do so, an series of steps are required.
The list below details each of these steps, and each step is explained in more
detail in the following sections.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        Extend the MetaDoc DTD with the definition of the data.
    \item
        A definition file explaining the data on the client.
    \item
        An entries file, explaining any entries allowed in the data on the 
        client.
    \item
        A \texttt{MetaInput} or \texttt{MetaOutput} sub class that should
        handle data, depending on whether data is recieved or sent to or from
        the server, respectively.
    \item
        Adding a handle to \texttt{main.py} that will activate the data type.
    \item
        Configuring the server to send or recieve the intended data.
\end{enumerate}

Figure \ref{fig:connection_example} shows an example of how the data for
projects is defined, and the connection between classes that are used when data
about projects is recieved from the server.


\subsection{Altering DTD}
\textit{The XML document follows certain conventions that should be followed when
extending the DTD. These conventions are explained in more detail in section
\ref{sec:xmldoc}.}

Before you alter the DTD you should know exactly what data should be sent.
Create an \texttt{<!ELEMENT>} with a descriptive name of the data sent. As an
example, \texttt{<users>} is used for a list of users. 

Add any attributes necessary to describe the set of data. If the data is a list
of entries, such as a list of users, create an \texttt{<!ELEMENT>} as a
possible sub-element that contains the information about each entry. Any short
information about the entry should be placed in attributes of the entry. If
there is more information, such as information that could be several sentences
or lines, it should not be placed as an attribute. This information should be
placed inside the element itself. If there are several types of long
information for each entry, create a descriptive \texttt{<!ELEMENT>} for each
as a sub-element of each entry to contain the text. Otherwise the text may be
placed directly inside the entry element itself. 

As an example, the MetaDoc DTD \cite{metadoc_dtd} defines
\texttt{project\_entry}, where \texttt{remarks} and \texttt{description} are
allowed sub-elements that contain any text. Meanwhile, \texttt{resourceUp} and
\texttt{resourceDown} places the text directly inside the tag itself, as not
other information is allowed inside these tags.

\subsection{Defining the data client side}
\label{sec:defclientmodel}
Add a package to the client with the name of the main element
\cite{python_modules}. Create a module \texttt{definition} inside this package.
\texttt{definition} should define the main element with a sub class of
\texttt{metaelement.MetaElement}.

Create a module \texttt{entries} inside the same package. This file should
contain definitions of each entry, and potential sub elements for each entry,
as a sub class of \texttt{metaelement.MetaElement}. 

Add the entry class(es) to \texttt{self.legal\_element\_types} of the \\ 
\texttt{metaelement.MetaElement} sub class defining the main element. 

\texttt{metaelement.MetaElement} sub classes may define a
\texttt{clean\_<attribute name>()} for each attribute on the element. This method
will recieve the attribute value, and should return the attribute value after
any potential cleaning is done on it. Please note that \textit{all} attribute
values \textit{must} be strings, so if any value set as an attribute might be
set as anything other than a string, the clean-function is the place to convert
it. If the attribute contains a value that is not allowed, a sub class of
\texttt{metaelement.IllegalAttributeError} should be raised that defines the
error that has occoured. 

The \texttt{metaelement.MetaElement} defines some methods that are commonly
used in cleaning methods, such as converting a \texttt{date} object into an
RFC3339 string, or checking for legal values of an attribute. See section
\ref{sec:useful_classes} for more information about these functions and how to
build these classes.

\subsection{Custom client handles}
If the data is to be sent from client to server, create a module
\texttt{custom/site<main element name>.py} that contains a sub class of
\texttt{custom.abstract.MetaOutput}. This class should define a method
\texttt{populate()} which gathers the information to be sent from the site and
appends an instance of a entry-class, as defined in section
\ref{sec:defclientmodel}, to \textbf{self.items} for each entry.

If the data is sent from server to client, a module called
\texttt{custom/update<main element name>.py} should be created that contains a
sub class of \\ \texttt{custom.abstract.MetaInput}. This class should define a
method \texttt{process()} that processes any recieved data in
\textbf{self.items}.  

See section \ref{sec:client_api} and \ref{sec:useful_classes} for more
information on these classes.


\subsection{Versioning}
MetaDoc passes a \textbf{version} attribute on it's root element,
\texttt{<MetaDoc>} when sending information between client and server. This
version is a string on the form ''\texttt{X}.\texttt{Y}.\texttt{Z}'', where
\texttt{X}, \texttt{Y} and \texttt{Z} are numbers. Changes made to each number 
indicate different levels of breakage. 

When \texttt{X} is changed, changes are made such that the current information
passed is changed in some way. This may be changes to the DTD where any of the
currently passed information is affected (addition/removal of attributes,
changes to how attribute values are presented or should be parsed,
addition/removal of sub-elements). If the client or server encounters a
document with a different value of \texttt{X} in the version number, it should
\textit{not} accept the data, as it cannot be sure it will handle it correctly.

Changes to \texttt{Y} indicates a change that does \textit{not} change the
current behaviour in any way, but may be instances where new information might
be passed. When the client or server encounters a document with a different
value of \texttt{Y} it should log a warning, but otherwise proceed as normal.

\texttt{Z} is currently not used for anything, but is present for potential
usability in the future. Differences in \texttt{Z} should be logged as debug
information.
